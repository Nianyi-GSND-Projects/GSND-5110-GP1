# GSND 5110 Group Project \#1

This README document is written and maintained by [Nianyi Wang](https://github.com/WangNianyi2001), the lead developer of this project.

## Objectives

In this group project, we need to design & implement a short clip of a videogame no longer than 5 minutes to deliver a certain type of human emotion.
The emotion our group (group \#4) have chosen is: **Skeptism**.

## Project Files Organization

The game prototype is developed with Unity (version `2022.3.34f1`).
The entire Unity project is stored in the directory `/Skepticism`, only necessary files included.
One could clone/download a copy of this repository to fiddle around with the project.
