      that\u2019s not a random name, it\u2019s, simple, yet elegant.\nNow, your goal
      is to get to the exit of these rooms following the path just shown to you.\nYou
      may try as many times as you wish, however, do keep in mind that you\u2019re
      facing a 9x9 dimension set of rooms.\nIn a simpler setting of say 3 by 3, assuming
      you do not repeat rooms walking in Hamiltonian fashion, you already have a
      whopping 246 possible paths.\nSo do not expect to find the one correct path
      by trial and error.\nUse your memorization; recall what you saw was the right
      path.\nOr at times, use your imagination.\nGood luck, adventurer."
