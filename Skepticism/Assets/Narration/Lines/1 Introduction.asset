    text: "Welcome, dear adventurer. It is our greatest honor to introduce you to
      this epic game of\u2026doors."
  - startTime: 9
    text: "Yes, that\u2019s it. \u201CThe Doors Game.\u201D No, that's not a random

  - startTime: 44
    text: Try to be observant and resilient.
  - startTime: 47
